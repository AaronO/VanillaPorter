Source for Vanilla 2 export tools.

For more information go to http://vanillaforums.org/page/porter.

Don't directly use this code to export your forum.
Use the compiled package at vanillaforums.org instead.

If you are modifying the code for your own purposes, don't modify vanilla2export.php directly.
Modify the other source files and then run or browse to make.php and it will generate a new copy of vanilla2export.php.
